# AI-Insect-Fact-Generator (Client)
Webpage which uses the Hugging Face and Pixabay API to create a unique insect fact, inference the insect name from the fact, and find a real image to go alongside it

Please note that the backend API is running on a seperate free hosting service in order to mask my API keys. If your requests take longer than ~15 seconds its very likely that the service has spun down due to inactivity. \
\
If this is the case, please allow the request to continue to load. It will load up to 90 seconds at which point it will timeout and let you try again. \
Once the server is up and running request typically only take ~5-10 seconds.
